                <p>Our goal is to manufacture DNA nanostructures with desired size by using DNA origami technology. Shape-complementary interfaces on DNA origami enables us to stack DNA origami blocks to form a large-scale polymeric object, however, the number of stacking is still difficult to be controlled. </p> 
<p>Here we show that through designing the configuration and arrangement on protrusions and recessions of DNA origami surface, the number of stacking origami monomers can be precisely controlled.</p>
<p>We designed an origami which has an ability to transform its shape triggered by an input of single-stranded DNA. When we add the input, initial shape (Shape C) is changed into another shape with different width/height(Shape O).Owing to the shape- complementary interfaces, only the combination of Shape C and Shape O can stack with each other. Based on the principle of least common multiple, the stacking procedure continues until the width/height becomes identical. Moreover, by adjusting the width/height ratio between Shape C and Shape O, it is possible to realize DNA nanostructures with designated size made of one kind of monomers.</p>
<p>We anticipate our design to be a starting point to make micro-scale DNA nanostructures. For example, the cytoskeleton for artificial cell, the body of molecular robots and the base of nano chemical factory could be manufactured. Furthermore, combining our method with DNA computing could provide a brand-new possibility for molecular robotics.

                <h2>1. Background</h2>
                <p>Nano scale structures and devices that can transform and polymerize have been developed by using DNA as a building block. One of the representative technologies to create DNA nano structures is DNA origami. Since DNA scaffold has limit of length, the size of DNA nano structures is at most 100nm by 100nm. We can’t create larger structures like cytoskeleton for artificial cell because of this limit of size. To solve this problem, we need a new technology to create DNA nano structures of arbitrary size beyond the limit.</p>

                <h2>2. The purpose</h2>
                <p> DNA origami technology enables us to make various nanoscale structures [3]. However, the maximum size of DNA origami is limited to 100 nm due to the length of the scaffold. Although DNA origami could stack together on the basis of the shape-complementary interfaces, the number of stacking cannot be controlled [1]. In order to create large structures by stacking DNA origami blocks, we need many kinds of origami with different connectors. The purpose of our project is to create structures with designated size by stacking only one kind of DNA origami blocks in a controllable way.</p>

                <h2>3. Project idea</h2>
                <p>To achieve the purpose, we proposed a new method to control the number of stacking origami blocks. In this method, a shape-complementary interface with protrusions and recessions on both sides is designed. By adjusting the length/width ratio of the origami blocks, the stacking procedure could stop at a specified height in accordance with the principle of least common multiple. Furthermore, the origami blocks have abilities to transform from closed state to open state, providing the possibility to use only one kind of block to build origami architecture like a tower, while avoiding the improper stockings.</p>

                <h2>4. Procedure</h2>
Our approach consists of the following 3 steps.

                <div>
                    <h3>Step 1: Design</h3>
                    1. The shape-complementary interface of DNA origami blocks is designed by caDNAno2. The thermodynamic stability of the DNA origami is simulated by CanDo. Its molecular dynamic property is simulated by oxDNA.<p>
                  
                    2. The opening/closing mechanism to control the activation of the origami block is designed by Sequence Design, and NUPACK is to confirm the desired strand displacement reaction.
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Step 2: Simulation</h3>
                    1. A mathematical model for stacking reactions by reaction kinetics is formalized.<p>
                    2. The behavior of the model is predicted by Scilab.
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Step 3: Experiment</h3>
                    1. Origami preparation: to make DNA origami with strands of opening/closing mechanism<p>
                    2. Poly-Agarose Gel Electrophoresis: to verify the behavior of opening/closing mechanism.<p>3.	Observation by Atomic Force Microscope: to verify the shape of DNA origami blocks, the transformation from open state to closed state, and the stacking procedure.

                <p>We considered building a tower by using only one kind of DNA origami block (Fig 1). Herein, we designed the origami block by caDNAno2. It is composed of two parts, Block 1 and Block 2. The hinge-joint between Block 1 and Block 2 enables the origami to possess of two different closed state (Shape C) and open state (Shape O) (Fig.2A-2C).</p>
                
                <figure id="fig-1">
                    <img src="./assets/fig-1.png" width="400px;">
                    <figcaption>Fig.1</figcaption>
                </figure>
    <p>We have known that DNA origami blocks with shape-complementary interfaces can stack together. The blocks we designed have protrusions on obverse surface (Surface A) and recessions on reverse surface (Surface B). Moreover, nucleobase stacking interactions engage at the double-helical interfaces of the shape-complementary protrusions and recessions when the two domains are brought into contact, but only upon correct fit of helices and given correct helical orientation of the interfacial nucleobase pairs. Therefore, only Surface A of Shape C and Surface B of Shape O has the ability to stack with each other (Fig.3).</p>
    <p> We also designed an opening/closing mechanism to realize the transformation from Shape C to Shape O. In Fig. 4, we graft some single-stranded DNAs to the origami blocks. When we add the initial input of a single-stranded DNA, which has the complementary sequences to the ones grafted to the blocks, Shape C transforms into Shape O due to the strand displacement reaction. Once the block becomes open state, it has the ability to activate the next closed block.</p>
    <p> We controlled the height of the tower, namely the number of stacking blocks, according to the principle of least common multiple (Fig.5). For example, if we intend to build a 6-story tower, we prepare an origami block which has two pairs of protrusions on Surface A and three pairs of recessions on Surface B. Through the opening/closing mechanism mentioned above, we could realize the situation where there are two closed blocks and three open blocks and the stacking procedure would stop when all the six pairs of protrusions and recessions combined with each other. Generally, we could build polymeric blocks with any designated height by changing the length-width ratio of the monomer blocks.

               <p>We have known that DNA origami blocks with shape-complementary interfaces can stack together. The blocks we designed have an ability to transform from inactive state to active state( Fig. 2-1 ). Herein, we define the observe side of the inactive blocks and the reverse side of the active blocks as Surface A and Surface a in the method mentioned above, while the reverse side of the inactive blocks and the observe side of the active blocks are defined as Surface B. Moreover, nucleobase stacking interactions engage at the double-helical interfaces of the shape-complementary protrusions and recessions when the two domains are brought into contact, but only upon correct fit of helices and given correct helical orientation of the interfacial nucleobase pairs. Therefore, the inactive blocks cannot stack with the active blocks, because the helical orientation of DNA in Part α and Part β are perpendicular to each other( Fig. 2-2 ).</p>

                <p> We developed two ways to avoid improper stacking of blocks( Fig. 3-1 ).One is making protrusions cross the centerline of the inactive blocks, which prevents the inactive blocks from stacking with each other( Fig. 3-2 ) The other is decreasing the concentration of the active blocks, which reduces the stacking of the active blocks.</p>

                 <p>We also developed an opening-closing mechanism to realize the transformation from inactive state to active state. In Fig. 3-3, we graft a single-stranded DNA to Point P and Q respectively. When we add another input of single-stranded DNA, which has the complementary sequences to the ones grafted to Point P and Q. Hence, the amount of the active blocks can be controlled by adjusting the concentration of the input. But if the amount is too small, blocks cannot complete correct stacking. Thus, we introduced a system, where the active block and inactive block stack with each other precisely(Fig 3-4).Under this circumstance, the next inactive block is able to be activated, since the block could not move freely in solutions.</p>

                DNA blocks connect with each other to make bigger one by DNA stacking, then finally enlarge up to the expected size. We made a simulation model in order to confirm the process of building blocks, using Scilab. By writing down all the ordinary differential equations of reaction rate, we got the time series graphs of concentrations of each size of DNA blocks.  The following URL shows the source code and all the intermediates.

                <h3>1.Comparison with other approaches</h3>
                Compared with existing method, the proposed method enables us to build large structures using homogeneous monomers. By arranging the orientation of protrusions and recessions on the surface and adjusting the length/width ratio of DNA origami blocks, we can make various structures with specified size by self-assembly.
                <h3>2.Significance of this work</h3>
                 The entire biological world can be regarded as a huge hierarchical system composed of homogeneous and heterogeneous layers [4]. The homogeneous layer is able to form the heterogeneous layer with various sizes and complexities autonomously, such that cells form tissues and organs. Inspired by this self-organizing hierarchy, we propose a novel method to make DNA Nano structures with designated size using homogeneous monomers.<p>
                     This method enables us to make large-scale complex nanostructures. For example, if we programmed the order to build different sizes of polymeric DNA architectures, a molecular stair can be established autonomously. Furthermore, the combination of these polymeric DNA architectures can be used as parts to build molecular robots (Fig 1).
